Previous HEAD position was e82841fe2a RelativeMap: down sampled raw navigation path data. Apollo 3.0 used a new smoothing algorithm to generate the navigation path, which makes the number of points in the navigation path very large. It may cause the ROS buffer to overflow and thus result in the navigation path not being sent successfully. Using a down sampling strategy can effectively solve this problem. Instructions: 1. Do not use downsampling  bash /apollo/scripts/navigator.sh left.smoothed right.smoothed --navigator_down_sample=0 2. Use downsampling   bash /apollo/scripts/navigator.sh left.smoothed right.smoothed --navigator_down_sample=1 or   bash /apollo/scripts/navigator.sh left.smoothed right.smoothed
